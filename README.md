#S BrewPi-ipindel
Integrating the iSpindel hydrometer into BrewPi - Just starting out.

As soon as I get a clearer idea of how to make it work, it will be here. The general idea is:

One script to accept input from the iSpindel and log it - probably keeping the most recent x data points.
Modify existing scripts to add the logged data to the currently used JSON and CSV files.
Modify existing files to plot newly added data.
