# BrewPi-iSpindel
Integrating the iSpindel into BrewPi

Very much a work in progress and just running the first test brew on it now, but if you want to test it out, here you go....

Install info is in the Documentation folder. Most of the files are ready to go as-is, and are a drop in replacement for the current version of a legacy branch installation.

I will be making some adjustments after this brew finishes.
